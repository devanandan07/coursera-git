## Introduction

This project provides a straightforward way to calculate simple interest. It takes three inputs: the principal amount, the rate of interest, and the time period. The formula used for the calculation is:

\[ \text{Simple Interest} = \frac{P \times R \times T}{100} \]

where:
- \( P \) is the principal amount
- \( R \) is the rate of interest per year
- \( T \) is the time period in years

## Features

- Easy to use
- Lightweight and fast
- Supports various input methods

## Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine using:

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/calculating-simple-interest.git](https://github.com/devanandan07/coursera-git.git)
